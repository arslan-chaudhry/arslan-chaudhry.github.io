    <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am a DPhil (PhD) student in the <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Etvg/" target="_blank">Torr Vision Group</a> at the University of Oxford working under the supervision of <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Ephst/" target="_blank"> Prof. Philip H. S. Torr</a>. I am a <a href="https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/community/list-of-rhodes-scholars" target="_blank">Rhodes Scholar</a> from Pakistan for 2016. Before joining Oxford, I worked as a software developer at <a href="https://www.mentor.com/" target="_blank">Mentor Graphics</a> for more than three years developing <a href="https://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/hypervisor/" target="_blank">Mentor Embedded Hypervisor.</a> Prior to that, I did my undergraduate in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="http://www.uet.edu.pk/" target="_blank">University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore</a> where I graduated at the top of my class.
        <p>I am exploring the use of Deep Learning in solving vision. My goal is to design agents that can learn continually over an indefinite period of time. To achieve this continual/ life-long learning type of a scenario, I am trying to solve catastrophic forgetting in neural nets these days.

        <p>When I am not in my lab, I can be seen riding my bicycle in the lamplit Oxford alleys.
